# Artist Extractor Script

This is a specialized script (that nobody will probably ever find the use for?).

I first got a list of all my songs by running '''ls -alR''' on my local music library, using directory name as the playlist name.

Then, I ran the following parse.sh script to separate out the authors and sort them according to the occurence.
